# Atlanta Care Center — website

A static rebuild of [atlantacare.com](https://www.atlantacare.com) that anyone can edit
from a browser, with no developer and (almost) no hosting bill.

- **Site:** [Astro](https://astro.build) → plain HTML/CSS. 16 pages, ~1 second build.
- **Content:** Markdown + YAML files in `src/content/`. That *is* the database.
- **Hosting:** Cloudflare Pages (free) with the source on GitHub (free).
- **Editing:** a form-based editor at `/admin/` (Option 1, Sveltia CMS) or `/tina-admin/`
  (Option 2, TinaCMS). Both read and write the same content files; you'd keep one.

```
src/content/singles/site.yml   phone, address, hours, booking/portal links, menu, footer text
src/content/singles/home.yml   the home page
src/content/pages/*.md         every other page (folders = URL paths)
public/images/                 photos and icons
public/docs/                   the two privacy PDFs
```

## Run it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # site at http://localhost:8171 (Option 1 editor at /admin/)
npm run dev:tina       # same, plus the Option 2 editor at /tina-admin/
```

## How editing works

Every page is made of a small set of blocks the editor understands:

| Block | What it is |
|---|---|
| Call to action | Centered heading + "Book Now" button (the rose watermark) |
| Text block | Rich text, optionally over a wide background photo |
| Two columns | Two side-by-side columns; each is text *or* an image |
| Photo + text rows | Alternating image/text rows with "Learn More" buttons |
| Questions & answers | Accordion FAQ |
| Contact details | Phone, address and hours, pulled from Site Settings |

Phone number, hours and address live in **Site Settings** and appear everywhere
automatically (the phone number is auto-linked wherever it's typed).
In headings, `**bold**` is bold and `*italic*` becomes the handwriting style.

### Option 1 — Sveltia CMS (`/admin/`)

- Zero build step; one `<script>` tag (`src/pages/admin.astro`) and one config file
  (`public/admin/config.yml`).
- Editors sign in with GitHub. Saving commits straight to the repo; Cloudflare rebuilds
  the site in ~30 seconds.
- On a laptop, open `http://localhost:8171/admin/` in Chrome/Edge and choose
  **Work with Local Repository** → pick this folder. Edits are written to disk
  and the dev server reloads.

### Option 2 — TinaCMS (`/tina-admin/`)

- Same content files, but with a WYSIWYG editor for text instead of Markdown.
- Needs a (free-tier) Tina Cloud account for production sign-in, and a `tinacms build`
  step before `astro build` (`npm run build:tina`).
- Locally, `npm run dev:tina` runs Tina's content server; saving writes to disk.

Both can coexist for evaluation. To keep only Sveltia: `npm uninstall tinacms @tinacms/cli`,
delete `tina/`, `src/pages/tina-admin.astro`, `scripts/tina-proxy.mjs`.
To keep only Tina: delete `public/admin/` and `src/pages/admin.astro`.

## Going live (Cloudflare Pages + GitHub)

1. Create a GitHub repo (e.g. `atlantacare/atlantacare`) and push this folder to `main`.
2. Cloudflare dashboard → **Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → Connect to Git** → pick the repo.
   - Build command: `npm run build` (or `npm run build:tina` for Option 2)
   - Output directory: `dist`
3. Add the custom domain `www.atlantacare.com` (and `atlantacare.com`) in Pages → Custom domains.
   This needs the domain's DNS on Cloudflare — check who controls it before cutover.
4. **Option 1 sign-in:** deploy the tiny [sveltia-cms-auth](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms-auth)
   Worker (free; ~5 minutes, it's a "Deploy to Cloudflare" button), create the GitHub OAuth
   app it asks for, then set `repo` and `base_url` in `public/admin/config.yml`.
   Editors need a GitHub account with write access to the repo — one shared
   "atlantacare-web" account is fine.
5. **Option 2 sign-in:** create a project at app.tina.io, connect the repo, and set
   `TINA_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID` and `TINA_TOKEN` as Pages environment variables.

Ongoing cost: the domain registration. Everything else is on free tiers.

## Where the content came from

`../atlantacare-scrape/` holds the original site's rendered HTML, images, theme CSS and
`extract.py`, which produced `src/content/`. The orphaned Testimonials page (lorem ipsum)
was not migrated. Fonts: the original used Adobe Fonts (Roboto Condensed + Al Fresco);
this uses self-hosted Roboto Condensed + Herr Von Muellerhoff, the closest free match.
